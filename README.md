# projet-visu-2021-2022
Projet visualisation Charleroi 2021-2022

<pre>

Todo-list:
-Make logo
-Add logo to header
-Make sections of website resize automatically, depending on the size of the window
-Change filters "price" and "note" to a slider
-Make buttons bigger generally
-Make a database for the restaurants (includes locations, notes, descriptions and random photos)

Not to do yet (would make the code too heavy to change)
-Make a map
-Make a list
  Let's finish the main structure of the page first, then we can add these features.


Lisibility rules:
-Please write in english
-Add comments if you feel like it help understand the piece of code
-Make as many files as you can, the more files, the smaller they are, the easier they are to read.
-Don't make useless complicated stuff :^) (yes I'm looking at you Maxim lol)
