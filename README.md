Todo-list:
-TOP PRIORITY: Fix the split view page.

-Make a database for the restaurants (includes locations, notes, descriptions and random photos)
-Make the map better (less laggy, take full size of bottom container)
-Make a list
-Fix size of vertical container (it's too big)



Lisibility rules:
-Please write in english
-Add comments if you feel like it help understand the piece of code
-Make as many files as you can, the more files, the smaller they are, the easier they are to read.
